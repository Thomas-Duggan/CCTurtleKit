## Purpose

A header file that can be imported using:
```
local cctk = require("CCTurtleKit")
```
Note: run "import" and drag and drop the file into Minecraft to import into other files

NOTE FOR startup.lua:
This file is NOT neccessary for proper usage of CCTurtleKit.lua.
It is exclusively for ease of setup and ease of use. 
**IF YOU HAVE AN EXISTING startup.lua DO NOT IMPORT MINE.**
